## Description

I decided to build this project to provide a quick way for developers to create readme files! The problem my application solves is the tedious process of formatting a readme using markdown. Alleviating the pain of correctly spacing and using proper symbols to create bullets and numbers lists, my application takes all of these factors into account and allows a user to input there desired outputs and have them automatically formatted! I learned how to use properly use nodeJS and inquirer which I obtained from https://www.npmjs.com/. I was able to use only javascript to completely generate a formatted document, which is a very exciting accomplishment for me.
